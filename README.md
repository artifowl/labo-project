# Labo Project

## Description
Labo Project is a server-side system designed to analyze submitted source code, track student progress, and provide personalized advice.

The project follows a three-step logic:
1. **Parsing**: Syntax analysis of the submitted code.
2. **Analysis**: Evaluation of the code based on various criteria.
3. **Conclusion**: Generation of recommendations and feedback.

## User Interface (UI/UX)
Three types of interfaces will be explored:
- **Web Application**: An interface accessible via a browser.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A lightweight and fast solution.
- **Desktop Application**: A standalone software with a graphical interface.

## Project Timeline
### 1. Parsing (`02/04/2025 - 15/04/2025`) - *2 weeks*
- 📌 Define the project architecture.
- 📚 Study and understand the necessary C libraries.
- 🛠 Develop the parsing module to analyze submitted source code.

### 2. Analysis (`15/04/2025 - 15/05/2025`) - *1 month*
- 📝 Define the criteria for code analysis.
- 🔍 Implement algorithms for error detection and code quality assessment.
- 🔗 Integrate with the parsing module.

### 3. Conclusion and Feedback (*To be defined*)
- 🗒 Generate recommendations based on the analysis.
- 🖥 Integrate with user interfaces.
- 🧪 Testing and improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Primary Language**: `C` (for analysis and parsing)
- **Frameworks/Web**: *(To be determined based on the chosen option)*
- **Database**: *(If needed, to be determined)*

## Current Status
🔄 *In the definition and structuring phase of the project.*
